title: 'Iron (Fe) - Metal, Ductile, Lustrous, and Powerless in JNU'

The first time I ever saw Aishe Ghosh on TV, I already admired her. She spoke on the nightmarish debates with civility, and I admired that more than anything. Patience, civility, and a genuine attempt at communication. And now on Twitter blood was coming out of her skull. I have been brutally attacked, she said, I’m not even in a condition to speak. Gone was the composure, the courage and civility. What was left was raw helplessness, grief, shock. Iron rods do that to a person. And then I heard the ambulance siren. Ambulances often pass by my house. I live very close to the road for AIIMS. I refreshed my twitter. They were taken to AIIMS Trauma Center, 15 students, and teachers. to the AIIMS Trauma Center.

_Man shouting "Goli maaro saalon ko" outside the JNU main gate._

It’s a strange word - trauma. It implies an inextricable, often haunting, link between the past and the future. And trauma is the mob’s best-case scenario - that each time the students think about stepping out for a protest, the images of the masked men, attacking them with rods, flash before them, and they stay in. If there is trauma, I imagine that what would linger most would be the eyes. What do their eyes look like, people who are smashing your head with steel rods? That must be what stays. That there are eyes out there in the world that carry that much hatred for you. How does one live with that without looking over their shoulders forever?

I went to JNU that night at 9pm to protest against the violence. Friends had instructed me to stay safe. Reaching the main gate, I was already in violation of that instruction. “Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro saalon ko.” was the resounding naara that filled the sky under which the police stood at the university’s entrance. I was surrounded by so much outrage, so much disgust, for people like me. I couldn’t understand where it came from. _Kiya kya humne? Thode naare laga liye yaar, thoda protest hi kar liya._ I have learned recently in therapy that emotions can be false, manufactured out of thin air through beliefs that you hold that are just not true. This was the only way to make sense of the anger I was in the middle of. It’s false. Its made up stuff. We did nothing, nothing, to deserve it. 

There was an astounding lack of fear for repercussions, and that indeed felt like it was the whole point. The message was clear - _We will smash your heads and then stand outside your door, and look, and remember, that nobody will touch us_. I was taking videos. I don’t really know why. Somehow, that was the only way for me to experience this mob, as not just myself but as potentially the eyes of the whole country. 

A guy came up to me wearing a white napkin on his face. He looked young. 25, perhaps. He asked me the time. I looked at my phone for the time. I did not feel threatened. I should have, but somehow I trusted him. He was another student, after all. On a different day I could have made the wardrobe choices he had. Somehow, when I imagine violence, I don’t think of a skinny 25-year-old guy wearing Reebok shoes. But my illusion broke when two other guys, both wearing napkins, tried to create a circle around me. 

I started pacing away from them. 

“Haan tu bhaag, tu kitni dur bhagega?” he said. The pretense was off. I felt betrayed, in a strange way. Reflecting on it now, I think this was the tragedy of the night of 5th January. That even students turned against students. In a conflict of ideas, iron rods found a place. 

His question was a good one. Kitni dur bhagega. The street ahead was empty, and black. The street lights were off. Why were the street lights off? Who got them switched off? The street lights outside the JNU main gate at 9:30 pm on 5th January when the mob was there - Why were they off? This is a question I keep asking myself, I keep asking other people, but nobody gives me an answer.

My strategy was bad, so I changed it. I ran to stand near Yogendra Yadav, where the cameras were. I held the hand of a policeman, and the mob left me, atleast in the moment. Within two minutes, I turned back and ran, went inside the thin gullies of Munirka, and kept running and taking turns to make enough of a maze. I don’t know if they tried to run behind me. I was too scared to turn around and look. 

I didn’t take a deep breath until I was at the metro station. And standing outside the station, all I could do was cry. To have returned to safety. To have left behind others who would bear the plight of the mob. I keep thinking about the fear - about why I felt it, why the image of that masked guy is still stuck in my head. _Maar hi toh dete thoda, kya hi ho jata?_ 

Perhaps what was scary was not the certain— which would be the beating — but the uncertain, that there is no reason for them to stop there. These men had been given the freedom to express their anger. And anger does not set boundaries for itself. When it is allowed expression, nobody can tell how far it will go. That is what’s the scariest - to be left to the plight of anger, to become the means through which it is expressed. I wonder if the only catharsis for this degree of anger is annihilation, and if it takes restraint to settle for anything less. In any case, on the night of 5th January, when more than a hundred police personnel were deployed outside the JNU main gate, any restraint the mob had to confront was mostly only their own. 

Later that night, I went back to JNU for another protest, this time thankfully in solidarity with the students. We stood outside the JNU gate, chanting ‘Azaadi’ and ‘Inqalaab’, reclaiming that space as our own, shouting so they may hear that we are with them. And sometime after midnight, the students came walking from inside, all chanting ‘We are JNU.’ The gates, which had been shut for hours, were pushed open from inside, and we all marched together, in solidarity. It felt like the furious roar of an injured lion, filled to the brim with courage and strength.

I don’t know, I can’t imagine, how the students of JNU or Jamia or AMU come back on the street with bandages on their skulls. I saw Aishe yesterday addressing the students of JNU, her head wrapped in bandages, hands in plaster. She stood and appealed to the students of JNU who wanted to leave campus. _Ye hamara ghar hai_, she said, _hamein yahin rehna hai_. How does one undo the past like that? How are these students not too traumatized to ever raise their voice again? The mob will be left to wonder. But one thing is clear - these students have learned to respond to trauma with strength. Iron rods can do many things, but it seems that they will not decide the fate of this movement.

title: 'My Morning Mug of Green Tea, And Preparedness for The Post-Ashokan Life'

Almost a year has passed since a substantial number of Ashoka’s undergraduates chose to unleash their critical thinking brains on the world outside Smogipat. Their new occupation, I imagine, is mostly to stand with a glass of red wine and a covert sense of superiority at work parties in Delhi, only barely resisting the urge to tear apart each hypothesis their politically-incorrect bosses put forward. I’ve met quite a few of them, these ex-Ashokans who’ve repressed their Marxism just enough to stay sane at work and fill in their timesheets. I must confess, I do feel a strong sense of disappointment in seeing these round pegs slowly start stretching into edges. “We were supposed to be in this together!” my heart screams, “rallying against the routine banality of bullshit labor for bullshit corporations.” 

Alongside this deep sense of betrayal, though, there is also the realization that the resistance to joining the workforce at Ashoka is a lot more like moody babies crying at parent-funded Daycare-for-the-rebellious than like an actual protest of any seriousness. After a while, you’re too old for it, your parents have no more money, and you gotta stop crying. And once you do, your critical thinking brain, despite itself, gives way to the pleasant realization that peaceful silence is, I don’t know, not that bad?

I’ve recently toiled with the benefits of silent conformity myself. This was, to some degree, inevitable - a natural consequence of putting oneself through three years of a certain discipline inquiring about the existence of chairs is that one’s questioning self starts to really question the value of questioning at all. As a result, I have been trying to inculcate in my day, some well-thought-out elements of unthinking: acts that you do not have to think about, that you just do. And the first of those, a reluctant baby step, is symbolized in my green tea mug. 

For the past month, I have begun my mornings with fifteen solitary minutes on my floor’s balcony with a wonderful view of a city covered in haze, sipping light green tea from my dark green mug. The mug, which now stands on my table with a smug self-righteousness, was gifted to me by the girl I love (and who loves me, except when I burp.) Whether I made this morning ritual out of my own agency or was programmed into it by her superior understanding of human psychology, we will never find out. But the experience of this ritual has helped me appreciate the bliss of routine unthinking, something that in my wholehearted determination towards critical thinking at Ashoka, I perhaps failed to understand.

After weeks of deeply cherished morning cups of green tea, I felt one morning that there is an obvious but often unrealized delight in planning a daily life with decidedly positive actions and experiences. The resolution to begin the day with calm, peaceful sips of tea all but algorithmically mandates a good mood, at least till one gets out of class at 1:20 and takes only a couple steps to find themselves at the tail of the mess line for lunch. But such a resolution feels like a betrayal to Ashokan values. The act of scheduling is inherently an act of planned unthinking. At Ashoka, there is a structural resistance to such scheduled action, since it is born out of unquestioned determination, not critical thought.

Ashoka has no dearth of people who use this resistance to unthinking in utterly creative ways - The True Ashokans do not miss class because they were too lazy. They make a utilitarian choice, finding no actual value in spending the next one and a half hours at a lecture. The True Ashokans don’t smoke out of an addiction. They smoke because the ideology of healthy living as opposed to ethical hedonism is rooted in a fundamentally baseless Christian morality. The True Ashokans don’t fail to switch off lights because they’re negligent. They’re just too smart to be trapped under neoliberal propaganda, transferring the blame for global warming from corporations to individuals. The True Ashokans never fail at anything. They just choose not to succeed because they see through the illusion behind its appeal. 

Eventually, the crystal palace of college crumbles to reveal a world where there is no longer space for critically thinking about the utility of circadian rhythms in the age of the tube light. We will find our overthinking brains lost, strangled, suffocated while running to catch the metro at 8:30 a.m just having finished chewing the breakfast butter toast, and hopefully, the experience will be thoroughly delightful. Not enough value is attributed to the pleasures of unthinking at Ashoka, where, one of my friends remarked lying under a starry sky in the mountains of Himachal, ‘we all live in our heads too goddamn much.’ 

So as I finished my penultimate mug of green tea last semester, sitting at the balcony in the company of the smog with which I’m now in a toxic relationship, I felt as if maybe post-college life will have its own pleasures, one of them being monotony. To wake up at 8 a.m everyday and know that your green mug is waiting to be picked up, and go to bed after a quick glance at it, standing smug as always, mildly excited for the fifteen minutes of peaceful solace next morning - as long as that’s there, how bad can the rest of it be?

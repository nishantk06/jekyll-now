Welcome to my blog! I'm Nishant Kauntia. I write long-form stories and essays for whoever will let me. I graduated with a degree in Philosophy and Media Studies from Ashoka University, where I was also a teaching fellow. I am currently living in Delhi, working as a freelance journalist for The Caravan, Scroll and other media houses.
